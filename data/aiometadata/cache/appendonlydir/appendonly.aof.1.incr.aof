On January 1, 2002, the company officially changed its name to PA Works (PA Works Co., Ltd.), and immediately moved the studio to its current location. The reason for its establishment is that Horikawa needs to return to the local area according to the family's agreement, and seeing that there is no mature animation studio in the local area, he decided to start a business. At the beginning of its establishment, due to limited funds, it was necessary to borrow an abandoned hospital for reconstruction, and to borrow the cable TV network to handle various administrative work. Since its establishment, the company has long been one of the cooperative partners of BEE TRAIN, Production IG and BONES.\nWith the development of the company's business, the company has not only established a branch in the capital, Tokyo, but also committed to improving the health and dormitory welfare of employees. At present, Toyama Head Office is mainly responsible for painting and 3D-CG production, while Tokyo office P-10 is responsible for performance and distribution production. In 2008, the company invested in the independent production of \"true tears\" for the first time, and used this to set a route for its early promotion of original animation and to maintain the high quality of the finished product. At the same time, the company also invested in the production of Q-style prints of \"Professor Layton Series\". As for the future outlook, the president has expressed the hope that one day he will be able to independently produce two films a year on average, with a total of more than 50 episodes of animation production throughout the year.","count":75},{"mal_id":17,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex","titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Aniplex"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"アニプレックス"}],"images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/s/common/company_logos/ba2241ea-7f83-45b6-9360-1f1d4de0d65a_600x600_i?s=369f1423117062ab3c7f4c7a90b2005a"}},"favorites":4214,"established":"1995-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","about":"Aniplex is a diversified entertainment company operating worldwide with focus on the planning and production of anime video and music content, its distribution in theaters and broadcast syndication as well as their respective physical and digital products, development of related game apps and merchandise such as figurines and apparel, stage production of musicals and live events, and operating the digital store \"Aniplex Online\" which provides hand-picked items for sale.\nAniplex' fully-owned subsidiaries include the anime production A-1 Pictures, mobile game app developer Quatro A, and Aniplex of America which leads the animation business outside of Japan.\n\n(Source: Official Website)","count":684},{"mal_id":95,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/95/Doga_Kobo","titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Doga Kobo"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"動画工房"}],"images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/s/common/company_logos/e820af66-29b6-48c2-bfba-43e9bd5d8c27_600x600_i?s=367d70746c45aaa5c1bb7295aeb46820"}},"favorites":4054,"established":"1973-07-11T00:00:00+00:00","about":"Doga Kobo (Doga Kobo, inc.) is a Japanese animation studio based in Nerima, Tokyo, Japan.

Kazushi Nomura and Toru Miura established AIC on July 15, 1982, with Nomura serving as the studio's president until leaving to found Another Push Pin Planning (APPP) on June 22, 1984. Following Nomura's departure, Miura assumed the role as the studio's president. As a result, the studio began producing works as a prime contractor, riding on the late 1980s OVA boom. The studio later expanded into game production (AIC Spirits) and the publishing business (AIC Club). In 2003, the studio shuttered AIC Spirits and AIC Club and reorganized itself into three sub-studios; AIC A.S.T.A. (now AIC ASTA), AIC Digital, and AIC Spirits. In February 2008, ACA-managed investment fund MCP Synergy acquired a 95% stake in the studio, and a new Anime International Company, Inc. was established through an incorporation-type demerger in May of the same year. In September 2010, Oizumi Corporation made AIC into a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company. In March of the following year, the studio became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Aplix Corporation. In January 2014, Aplix IP Holdings (now Aplix Corporation) announced its exit from its multimedia entertainment business, and transferred all of its shares in the studio to Toru Miura. In August 2015, the studio's animation production department was disbanded. The same year in December, Miura appointed Yasutaka Omura as the company's new representative director, and also transferred its classic IPs to AIC RIGHTS (AIC RIGHTS Co., Ltd.) through a corporation-separation procedure. In January 2020, Miura reassumed the representative director position from Omura.\n\nThe studio had several sub-studios within itself; in 2013, they consisted of: AIC ASTA, AIC Build, AIC Classic, AIC Digital, AIC PLUS+, and AIC Frontier. In addition, the studio also had a background art, CG, photography, finishing, and editing departments, as well as a recording and editing studio AIC Eastside Studio.","count":260},{"mal_id":1103,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1103/TROYCA","titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"TROYCA"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"トロイカ"}],"images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/s/common/company_logos/745cffb8-7566-4cfe-aab2-d89799d04d2b_600x600_i?s=1abac486697415e7c9fbd55622b379a8"}},"favorites":241,"established":"2013-05-23T00:00:00+00:00","about":"TROYCA (TROYCA Inc.) is a Japanese animation studio based in Nerima, Tokyo, Japan.

Although the film initially underperformed at the American box office, it became a cult classic, and has had a significant influence on science fiction. A novelization and a comic adaptation of the film were released in the same year. From 1995 to 2000, three novels serving as sequels to both “Blade Runner” and the original novel were written by K. W. Jeter, a friend of Dick’s. A sequel film called “Blade Runner 2049” was released in 2017. To celebrate the 30th anniversary of “Blade Runner” in 2012, a short film was released, and in the lead up to the release of “Blade Runner 2049,” several more short films detailing events that occurred between 2019 and 2049 were released.\r\n","url":"blade-runner","isOfficial":true,"nameTranslations":["deu","eng","por","spa"],"overviewTranslations":["deu","eng","spa"],"aliases":[],"score":613317,"image":"","imageIsFallback":false,"remoteIds":null,"tags":null},{"id":53,"name":"Paranormal Activity","overview":null,"url":"Paranormal-Activity","isOfficial":true,"nameTranslations":["eng"],"overviewTranslations":null,"aliases":[],"score":0,"image":"","imageIsFallback":false,"remoteIds":null,"tags":null},{"id":54,"name":"Final Destination Franchise","overview":"A lucky few survive a disaster.
